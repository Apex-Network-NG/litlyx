## Pre-Requisites

## Universal Installation

```html
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js"></script>
```

Importing Litlyx with a direct script already tracks 10 KPIs such as `Page visits`, `Browsers`, `Devices`, `OS`, `Real-Time Online Users`, `Unique Session`, `Countries`, `Average Session Time`.

# Import

Import litlyx-js library into your code:

```js
import { Lit } from 'litlyx-js';
```

Once imported, you need to initialize Litlyx:

```js
Lit.init('your_project_id');
```

After initialization, Litlyx will automatically track Analytics such as `Page visits`, `Browsers`, `Devices`, `OS`, `Real-Time Online Users`, `Unique Session`, `Countries`, `Average Session Time`.

# Custom Events

With Litlyx, you can create your own events to track in your project.

```js
Lit.event('click_on_buy_item');
```

If you want more dept tracking, you can use the `metadata` field, like this:

```js
Lit.event('click_on_buy_item', {
  metadata: {
    'product-name': 'Coca-Cola',
    'price': 1.50,
  }
});
```

You can create your Tailor-Made Experience at ease. 

# AI Data-Analyst
