## Pre-Requisites

Sign-up on [Litlyx.com](https://dashboard.litlyx.com) and create a project. Then simply use your project_id to connect Litlyx to your website OR Self-Host Litlyx with Docker.

## Universal Installation

```html
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js"></script>
```

Importing Litlyx with a direct script instantly starts tracking 10 KPIs, including `Page visits`, `Browsers`, `Devices`, `Operating Systems`, `Real-Time Online Users`, `Unique Sessions`, `Countries`, and `Average Session Time`.

# All Javascript Runtimes

You can install Litlyx using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`:

```sh
npm i litlyx-js
```

Litlyx natively works with all JavaScript / TypeScript frameworks. You can use Litlyx in all WordPress Websites by injecting JS code using a plug-in. Litlyx also works in serverless enviroments with Cloud (or Edge) Functions.

# Import

Import litlyx-js library into your code:

```js
import { Lit } from 'litlyx-js';
```

Once imported, you need to initialize Litlyx:

```js
Lit.init('your_project_id');
```

After initialization, Litlyx will automatically track analytics such as `Page visits`, `Browsers`, `Devices`, `Operating Systems`, `Real-Time Online Users`, `Unique Sessions`, `Countries`, and `Average Session Time`.

# Custom Events

You aren't just limited to the built-in KPIs. With Litlyx, you can create your own events to track in your project.

```js
Lit.event('click_on_buy_item');
```

If you want more specific tracking, you can use the `metadata` field, like this:

```js
Lit.event('click_on_buy_item', {
  metadata: {
    'product-name': 'Coca-Cola',
    'price': 1.50,
  }
});
```

Litlyx makes it easy for you to tailor your analytics to your project's needs.
