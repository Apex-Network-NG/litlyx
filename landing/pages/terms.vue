            These Terms of Service are applicable solely to LitLyx Analytics Cloud. They do not apply to LitLyx

            Please note these terms include limitations on our liability. Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) under the
            European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is incorporated into these Terms.

        <div class="font-bold mb-1 mt-4"> Account Terms</div>
        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8"> • You must secure your account and password. LitLyx Analytics is not liable for losses or
                damages resulting from
                your failure to protect your login information.</div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • You are accountable for all activities conducted under your account—even by others who
                have access to your
                account. </div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • You must not use our service for illegal purposes or in violation of any local laws.
            </div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • You must provide a legal full name and a valid email address to complete the signup
                process.</div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Only humans can register accounts. Registrations by bots or automated methods are not
                allowed. </div>
        </ul>

        <div class="font-bold mb-1 mt-4"> Payment, Refunds, Upgrading, and Downgrading Terms</div>
        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Our free trial details, including duration, are provided at signup. No credit card is
                needed for the trial,
                and your data is not sold. Post-trial, payment is required in advance to continue service use. Unpaid
                accounts
                will be frozen until payment is received. Accounts frozen for 60 days will be scheduled for
                auto-cancellation.</div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Upgrading from a free trial to a paid plan incurs immediate charges, and the billing
                cycle begins on the
                upgrade day. </div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Payments are processed automatically via credit card or PayPal.</div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Pageviews purchased must be used within the term; unused pageviews are forfeited.</div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • No additional charges for occasional traffic spikes. No surprise fees. </div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Exceeding the pageview limit of your plan for two consecutive months prompts a
                notification to upgrade. You
                have two weeks to respond, either continuing with a higher plan or cancelling. </div>
        </ul>


        <div class="font-bold mb-1 mt-4"> Cancellation and Termination</div>
        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8"> • You are solely responsible for properly cancelling your account. Email cancellation is
                not recognized.
                Cancellation instructions are provided.</div>
            <div class="ml-8"> • Cancellations take effect at the end of the current paid period; no further charges
                will be incurred.
                Post-cancellation, your stats are inaccessible and eventually permanently deleted from backups after 60
                days.</div>
        </ul>


        <div class="font-bold mb-1 mt-4"> Modifications to the Service and Prices</div>
        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any part of the service with or without notice.
            </div>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • Pricing changes may exempt existing customers, but we reserve the right to change prices for current
                users
                with 30 days notice via email or blog post.
            </div>
        </ul>


        <div class="font-bold mb-1 mt-4"> Privacy and Security of Your Data </div>
        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • We implement various security measures like backups, redundancies, and encryption to secure your data.
                You
                agree that we may process your site data as detailed in our data policy.
            </div>
        </ul>


        <div class="font-bold mb-1 mt-4"> General Conditions </div>
        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we strive for uptime, access to
                the
                service is not guaranteed.
            </div>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • We aim to design our services to meet diverse needs, but they may not meet every individual
                expectation.
            </div>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • We extensively test our features, but the possibility of bugs remains. We prioritize fixing
                significant bugs,
                especially those affecting security or privacy.
            </div>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <div class="ml-8">
                • You expressly understand and agree that LitLyx Analytics shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to
                you or
                to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive
                or
                exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or
                other
                intangible losses (even if the company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting
                from: (i)
                the use or the inability to use the services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and
                services
                resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or

                your
                transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other
                matter
                relating to this Terms of Service or the services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including
                negligence
                whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.
