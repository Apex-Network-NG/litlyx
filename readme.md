# Installation

You can install Litlyx using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`:

```sh
npm i litlyx-js
```

Or import it directly into your JavaScript code:

```html
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js"></script>
```

Importing Litlyx with a direct script already tracks 10 KPIs such as page visits, browsers, devices, OS, real-time online users, and many more.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you want to track custom events, you need to import the library with `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`. Continue reading to find out more!

#### You can find the official documentation: [here](https://docs.litlyx.com).

# Supported Frameworks

Litlyx natively supports all these JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks. You can use Litlyx in all WordPress projects by injecting JS code using plugins. You can even use Litlyx in cloud (or edge) functions in BaaS!

# Usage

Litlyx is very simple to use. The first thing is to import Litlyx into your code:

```js
import { Lit } from 'litlyx-js';
```

Once imported, you need to initialize Litlyx:

```js
Lit.init('your_project_id');
```

After this line, Litlyx will automatically track more than 10 KPIs for you.

# Customize Your Experience by Tracking Custom Events

With Litlyx, you can create your own events to track in your project on the main CTA. Your creativity is the limit! Customize your experience like this:

```js
Lit.event('main_cta');
```

This is the minimal setup for an event. If you want more control over them, you can use the `metadata` field:

```js
Lit.event('pretty_cool_event', {
  metadata: {
    'tag': 'litlyx is awesome!',
    'age': 27,
    'score': 100.01,
    'list': ['Hello', 'World!']
  }
});
```

And that's it! You have set up your first custom event. From now on, you know how to set them up. With events you can track even the user flow, from where they come to the final Click!
